1.test_for_experiment5_1        % the example 5.1 in the paper, 
2.test_for_experiment5_2        % the example 5.2 in the paper
3.test_for_experiment5_3        % the example 5.3 in the paper
3.test_for_experiment5_4        % the example 5.4 in the paper
4.test_for_l               % compute the suggested degree l in the preconditioner for the test problem 


Remarks:

1. The value of l can be set by running the test_for_l file to calculate an approximately optimal l, then set these value in test_for_experiment5_4

2. Just unfold all the files together such that the support functions are in the same folder as the main functions.
